# kalah-game

Kalah is a 2-player game, where a player wins by gaining more stones in his/her main pot, referred to as the mankalah.

The Kalah-game has been in existence for a very long time and is played in quite a number of countries around the world.
There are no global, defined rules to playing the game, hence, it is important that I define the rules applied in this one.

## Rules

1. The game is 6-stone 6-pot, this means that both players would be starting the game with 6 pots, bearing 6 
   stones each.
   Both players would have an additional pot, a special one, called the mankalah, to the farther right 
   (pot 7 would be the mankalah for player 1, and pot 14 would be the mankalah for player 2), and would have no 
   stones in it for the start.


2. On each player's turn, the player picks up the stones from his/her pots, and distributes it, moving in 
   ascending order (1 -> 14), dropping one in every pot he/she encounters including that of the opponent, until the
   stones finishes.
   

3. The player would drop a stone in his/her mankalah if he/she gets there. If the player gets to the mankalah of the
   opponent, the player would skip it, and drop in the next pot.


4. If the player's final stone for a round of play ends in his/her mankalah, that player gets the next turn and play 
   again.
   

5. If a player's final stone for a round of play, ends in his/her empty pot, if there are stones in the opposite pot 
   (the opponent's pot), the player would take that final stone plus the stones in the opposite pot, and put them 
   in his/her mankalah.
   

6. The game ends when either player has no stones in his/her 6 pots. At that point, the other player would return 
   his/her remaining stones to his/her mankalah.


7. The player with the highest stones in his/her mankalah, wins the game.
